      <p>
        My name is Jorge. I hold a degree in Mechanical Engineering from UTFPR
        and I am a car mechanic by passion, with over 25 years of experience in
        automotive and industrial maintenance and repairs.
      </p>

      <p>
        I work with a strong focus on accurate diagnostics, efficient solutions,
        and complete transparency with my clients. Before replacing any part,
        I always analyze the real cause of the problem.
      </p>

      <p>
        My goal is to provide a reliable, clear and fair service,
        always prioritizing quality, safety and cost-effectiveness.
      </p>

      <p>
        I understand that the stress and fast pace of everyday life often make it
        difficult to keep your vehicle properly maintained.
        Nothing is more frustrating than wasting time at a workshop for a small issue
        that keeps bothering you while driving.
        That is why I bring my service directly to you — quickly, efficiently and without complications.
